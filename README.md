- 👋 Hi, I’m @MoTolba
- 👀 I’m interested in learning coding, I neither have experience nor knowledge, and my field of experience is not directly relative to coding. but the Idea of Automation is very interesting for me.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning office scripts, VBA, Power Bi, etc. Generally I'm a fan of Microsoft products and would love to use that to support my goal of learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on achieving the best outcome of the study, for me or anyone elses.
